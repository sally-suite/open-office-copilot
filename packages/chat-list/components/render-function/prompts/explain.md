MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION FORMATTING:

Please express all mathematical formulas in LaTeX format, enclosed in either single dollar signs ($) for inline formulas or double dollar signs ($$) for display formulas. For example:

- Use $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ for inline equations
- Use $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$ for displayed equations

Please maintain proper LaTeX syntax including:

- Use proper fractions with \frac{numerator}{denominator}
- Use \sqrt{} for square roots
- Use proper subscripts with \_ and superscripts with ^
- Use \sum, \prod, \int for summation, product and integral symbols
- Include proper spacing with \space or ;
- Use \left( and \right) for dynamic parentheses sizing"
